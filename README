The 'devzone.harvest.py' and 'devzone.analysis.py' Python scripts can be used for analysis of PayPal X.com DevZone blog post and document feeds.

Use them with their supporting topic list 'devzone.topics.csv' to harvest, topic filter, and output DevZone feed data to CSV formatted files for further analysis elsewhere.

For more information, please refer to the documentation in the comments of each script file and also the Bill Day's two part PayPal X Developer Network article series, "Divining DevZone Insight from Filtered Feeds and Deep Pages".  The first part of this series is available now at:
